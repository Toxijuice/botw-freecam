# Breath of the Wild Freecam
## This is a modification of [botw-freecam](https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam). You may want to look at that one instead.

This version allows you to specify a process name other than `cemu.exe`, as well as changing some of the input behavior (mostly controller-based).

Mainly, I wanted to try using this with [NVIDIA Ansel](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/ansel-revolutionizing-game-screenshots/) to take HDR, panoramic screenshots of BotW. Sadly, [it takes some work to get Ansel working](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/ssdo26/use_anselfreestyle_on_any_game_without_the/) in a non-whitelisted game, which includes [changing the name of the exe](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/98cx95/comment/ech02qc/). 

I have had minor success so far, I will attempt to make a guide if anything comes of it.
